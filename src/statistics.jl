    loglikelihood(x::Number, D <: Datum)

Calculate the relativeÂ¹ log-likelihood that `x` is drawn from a distribution `D`, which may be normal ([`Norm`](@ref)), lognormal ([`logNorm`](@ref)), or uniform ([`Unf`](@ref)). Note that log-space constants are dropped from the calculations for efficiency (`metropolis only compares log-ratios`)

---

    loglikelihood(c<:Component, d<:Data)

Calculate the loglikelihood that the species composition/concentrations in `c` were drawn from the corresponding distributions in `d`.

---

    loglikelihood(s<:System , p<:Prior)

Calculate the loglikelihood that the components in `s` were drawn from the corresponding `Data` in `p`.

---

    loglikelihood(m::Vector, d::Measurements)
    loglikelihood(m<:Model , d<:DataSet)

Calculate the loglikelihood that the model compositions/concentrations in `m` were drawn from the corresponding measured distribution(s) in `d`.
