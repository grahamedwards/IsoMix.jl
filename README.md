Isotopic mixing models coupled to statistical tools. 

ðŸš§ Currently under construction: Experimental and largely nonfunctional ðŸš§



## Type structure in `IsoMix.jl`

Isotopic mixing models entail a number of different parameters. `IsoMix.jl` relies Julia's custom type system to 

To accommodate the flexible dimensionality of the package, specific instances of a given type typically have a trailing number indicates the number of dimensions (e.g. `Data` and `Data2`).


### Measurements

These reflect compositions determined from measurements, models, or assumptions. 

#### `Datum`
A `Datum` instance reflects a single measurement/model/assumption of a value. 
Measurement and model values will have corresponding uncertainties, so they are described by a distribution: uniform (`Unf`), normal (`Norm`), or lognormal (`logNorm`). The `Constant` struct allows you to assign a single, discrete value.

#### `Data`
A `Data` instance contains 1 or more `Datum` types and represents a suite of measurements for a specific chemical endmember composition:  `Data1`, `Data2`, `Data3`.

#### `Prior`
A `Prior` instance contains 1 or more `Data` types and represents a suite of measurements that provide a prior estimate for the endmember compositions of a natural system: `Prior2`, `Prior3`.

### Model compositions

The following types contain discrete values generated by/for mixing models.

#### `Component`
A `Component` instance contains discrete values for the isotopic composition (`x`, `y`, `z`) and concentration (`Cx`, `Cy`, `Cz`) of 1-3 species. `Component`s are 1-3 dimensional and represent the composition of a component or endmember within a natural system. 

#### `System`
A `System` instance contains 2 or more `Component`s and represents a  suite of measurements for a system of specific chemical endmember compositions.

### Calculations and outputs

#### `Fraction`
A `Fraction` instance contains vectors of fractional combinations of the constituent component/endmembers in a natural system. Mixtures in a `Fraction` correspond to `Model` compositions. See `?Fraction` for methods.

#### `Model`
A `Model` instance contains vectors of simulated isotopic composition and concentration of a species that correspond to the mixtures in a `Fraction` instance.
